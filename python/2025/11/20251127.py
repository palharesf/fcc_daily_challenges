# What's My Age Again?

# Given the date of someone's birthday in the format YYYY-MM-DD, return the person's age as of November 27th, 2025.

#     Assume all birthdays are valid dates before November 27th, 2025.
#     Return the age as an integer.
#     Be sure to account for whether the person has already had their birthday in 2025.

# Tests

# 1. calculate_age("2000-11-20") should return 25.
# 2. calculate_age("2000-12-01") should return 24.
# 3. calculate_age("2014-10-25") should return 11.
# 4. calculate_age("1994-01-06") should return 31.
# 5. calculate_age("1994-12-14") should return 30.

print(calculate_age("2000-11-20"))  # Expected output: 25

# Comments - not super tricky, but has good lessons
# Manipulating the tuples without the datetime library was unexpected but elegant
# My favorite part thou is the subtraction by True where True represents 1 
# I had never seen it before and it's quite cool

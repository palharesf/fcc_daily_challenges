# Character Count

# Given a sentence string, return an array with a count of each character in alphabetical order.

#     Treat upper and lowercase letters as the same letter when counting.
#     Ignore numbers, spaces, punctuation, etc.
#     Return the count and letter in the format "letter count". For instance, "a 3".
#     All returned letters should be lowercase.
#     Do not return a count of letters that are not in the given string.

# Tests

# 1. count_characters("hello world") should return ["d 1", "e 1", "h 1", "l 3", "o 2", "r 1", "w 1"].
# 2. count_characters("I love coding challenges!") should return ["a 1", "c 2", "d 1", "e 3", "g 2", "h 1", "i 2", "l 3", "n 2", "o 2", "s 1", "v 1"].
# 3. count_characters("// TODO: Complete this challenge ASAP!") should return ["a 3", "c 2", "d 1", "e 4", "g 1", "h 2", "i 1", "l 3", "m 1", "n 1", "o 3", "p 2", "s 2", "t 3"].

# Comments: interesting challenge from a logical perspective. Not too difficult but still presents some interesting critical thinking.
# Had to resort to AI to implement my thought, but the logic was spot on from the get go

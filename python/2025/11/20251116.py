# Rectangle Count

# Given two positive integers representing the width and height of a rectangle, determine how many rectangles can fit in the given one.

#     Only count rectangles with integer width and height.

# For example, given 1 and 3, return 6. Three 1x1 rectangles, two 1x2 rectangles, and one 1x3 rectangle.
# Tests

# 1. count_rectangles(1, 3) should return 6.
# 2. count_rectangles(3, 2) should return 18.
# 3. count_rectangles(1, 2) should return 3.
# 4. count_rectangles(5, 4) should return 150.
# 5. count_rectangles(11, 19) should return 12540.

def count_rectangles(width, height):
    return width * (width + 1) * height * (height + 1) // 4

count_rectangles(3, 2)
count_rectangles(1, 2)

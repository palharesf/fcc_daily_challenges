# Word Counter

# Given a sentence string, return the number of words that are in the sentence.

#     Words are any sequence of non-space characters and are separated by a single space.

# Tests

# 1. count_words("Hello world") should return 2.
# 2. count_words("The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.") should return 9.
# 3. count_words("I like coding challenges!") should return 4.
# 4. count_words("Complete the challenge in JavaScript and Python.") should return 7.
# 5. count_words("The missing semi-colon crashed the entire internet.") should return 7.

def count_words(sentence):
    words = sentence.split()
    return len(words)

count_words("The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.")
count_words("I like coding challenges!")
count_words("Complete the challenge in JavaScript and Python.")
count_words("The missing semi-colon crashed the entire internet.")

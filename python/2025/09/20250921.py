# Video Storage

# Given a video size, a unit for the video size, a hard drive capacity, and a unit for the hard drive, return the number of videos the hard drive can store using the following constraints:

#     The unit for the video size can be bytes ("B"), kilobytes ("KB"), megabytes ("MB"), or gigabytes ("GB").
#     If not given one of the video units above, return "Invalid video unit".
#     The unit of the hard drive capacity can be gigabytes ("GB") or terabytes ("TB").
#     If not given one of the hard drive units above, return "Invalid drive unit".
#     Return the number of whole videos the drive can fit.
#     Use the following conversions:

# Unit 	Equivalent
# 1 B 	1 B
# 1 KB 	1000 B
# 1 MB 	1000 KB
# 1 GB 	1000 MB
# 1 TB 	1000 GB

# For example, given 500, "MB", 100, and "GB as arguments, determine how many 500 MB videos can fit on a 100 GB hard drive.
# Tests

# 1. number_of_videos(500, "MB", 100, "GB") should return 200.
# 2. number_of_videos(2000, "B", 1, "TB") should return "Invalid video unit".
# 3. number_of_videos(2000, "MB", 100000, "MB") should return "Invalid drive unit".
# 4. number_of_videos(500000, "KB", 2, "TB") should return 4000.
# 5. number_of_videos(1.5, "GB", 2.2, "TB") should return 1466.

# Comments: same as previous problem, straightforward, good for focus on organizing code for readability

# Leap Year Calculator

# Given an integer year, determine whether it is a leap year.

# A year is a leap year if it satisfies the following rules:

#     The year is evenly divisible by 4, and
#     The year is not evenly divisible by 100, unless
#     The year is evenly divisible by 400.

# Tests

# 1. is_leap_year(2024) should return True.
# 2. is_leap_year(2023) should return False.
# 3. is_leap_year(2100) should return False.
# 4. is_leap_year(2000) should return True.
# 5. is_leap_year(1999) should return False.
# 6. is_leap_year(2040) should return True.
# 7. is_leap_year(2026) should return False.

def is_leap_year(year):
    return year % 4 == 0 and (year % 100 != 0 or year % 400 == 0)

print(is_leap_year(2024))
print(is_leap_year(2023))
print(is_leap_year(2100))
print(is_leap_year(2000))
print(is_leap_year(1999))
print(is_leap_year(2040))
print(is_leap_year(2026))

# Comments - straightforward, only three checks. Could have made all of them in different lines, but the final solution was the most elegant not considering inline (implicit) return
